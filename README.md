# Verbatim-Typer
## Overview
Verbatim Typer is a study tool that allows you to memorize anything - verbatim!

## Status: Finished
I created this study tool to help me memorize definitions for Discrete Math. More features can be added and interface can be significantly improved if needed.

### Files
- Verbatim Typer.exe - Standalone executable to launch the application window
