# Verbatim-Typer
## Overview
Verbatim Typer is a study tool that allows you to memorize anything - verbatim!

## Status: Finished
I created this study tool to help me memorize definitions for Discrete Math (*not fun* while it lasted). I would want to create an improved version with a better interface after my HCI studies. You know, the one that deserves a documentation.

### Files
- Verbatim Typer.exe - Standalone executable to launch the application window
- data.txt - Place this in the same directory with Verbatim Typer.exe. You can edit this file to customize memorizables. Begin a memorizable title by marking with **'@'** and start contents with **'#'**
- Verbatim Typer (directory) - Contains the Visual Studio solution and build files
